Year 2019. Events take place in a small German town called Winden. Two months ago, Jonas returned to the school with his father committing suicide. A couple of weeks ago when he came back, he learns that a child is lost in the town. Days of searching have remained unsuccessful and the whole town is on the thorn. With the disappearance of one of the children who have gone out to have fun together in order to get away from the tension of their parents, things get mixed up in the town.
