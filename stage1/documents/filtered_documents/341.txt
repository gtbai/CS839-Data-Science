# Archer

At an international spy agency, global crises are merely opportunities for its highly trained employees to confuse, undermine, betray and royally screw each other. At the center of it all is suave master spy {Sterling Archer}, whose less-than-masculine code name is "Duchess." {Archer} works with his domineering mother {Malory}, who also is his boss. He also has to deal with his ex-girlfriend, Agent {Lana Kane} and her new boyfriend, comptroller {Cyril Figgis}, as well as {Malory}'s lovesick secretary, {Cheryl}.
