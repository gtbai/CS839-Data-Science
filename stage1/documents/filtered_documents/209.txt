# The 400 Blows

Seemingly in constant trouble at school, 14-year-old {Antoine Doinel} returns at the end of every day to a drab, unhappy home life. His parents have little money and he sleeps on a couch that's been pushed into the kitchen. His parents bicker constantly and he knows his mother is having an affair. He decides to skip school and begins a downward spiral of lies and theft. His parents are at their wits' end, and after he's stopped by the police, they decide the best thing would be to let {Antoine} face the consequences. He's sent to a juvenile detention facility where he doesn't do much better. He does manage to escape however.
