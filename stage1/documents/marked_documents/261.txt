# The Sopranos

An innovative look at the life of fictional Mafia Capo {Tony Soprano}, this serial is presented largely first person, but additional perspective is conveyed by the intimate conversations {Tony} has with his psychotherapist. We see {Tony} at work, at home, and in therapy. Moments of black comedy intersperse this aggressive, adult drama, with adult language, and extreme violence.
