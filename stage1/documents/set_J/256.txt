# The Wire

Set in Baltimore, this show centers around the city's inner-city drug scene. It starts as mid-level drug dealer, {D'Angelo Barksdale} beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. {James McNulty} has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin {Avon Barksdale}. {Avon Barksdale}, accompanied by his right-hand man {Stringer Bell}, enforcer {Wee-Bey} and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, {D'Angelo Barksdale}), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, {Omar}, who's been robbing {Barksdale}'s dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. {Cedric Daniels}, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. {McNulty}, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug "food chain", from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians.
