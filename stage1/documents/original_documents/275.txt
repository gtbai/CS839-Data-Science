# Batman: The Animated Series

Heir to the Wayne family fortune, Bruce Wayne lives by day as a seemingly lavish playboy millionaire socialite, but by night assumes the role of his crime-fighting alter-ego: the caped crusader known as Batman. Throughout the Animated Series, Batman receives help from sidekicks Robin and Batgirl, as well as Police Commissioner Gordon, in protecting the streets of Gotham City from a large rogue's gallery of criminals, lunatics and nemeses.
