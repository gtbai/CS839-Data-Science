# Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

Two brothers lose their mother to an incurable disease. With the power of "alchemy", they use taboo knowledge to resurrect her. The process fails, and as a toll for using this type of alchemy, the older brother, {Edward Elric} loses his left leg while the younger brother, {Alphonse Elric} loses his entire body. To save his brother, {Edward} sacrifices his right arm and is able to affix his brother's soul to a suit of armor. With the help of a family friend, {Edward} receives metal limbs - "automail" - to replace his lost ones. With that, {Edward} vows to search for the Philosopher's Stone to return the brothers to their original bodies, even if it means becoming a "State Alchemist", one who uses his/her alchemy for the military.
