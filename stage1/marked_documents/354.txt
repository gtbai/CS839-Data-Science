# Black Adder the Third

During the Regency period, the insane King {George} III's stark raving mad son, {George}, is the Prince Regent of Wales. Vulgar and staggeringly slow-and-dim-witted, {George} exhausts the country's money and would surely be dead by now were it not for his dry, angry, bitter, arrogant and cynical butler, {Edmund Blackadder}, Esq. {Blackadder} is an ex-aristocrat who has lost his family fortune and been reduced to servant-hood, and full of loathing knowing he should have a better position then serving a lunatic. Sod-Off {Baldrick} is his dirty, smelly peasant servant, and Mrs. {Miggins} is an annoying cheerful coffee-shoppe owner who is too stupid to understand most of Mr. {Blackadder}'s insults.
