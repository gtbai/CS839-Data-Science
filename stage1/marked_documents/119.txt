# Downfall

In April of 1945, Germany stands at the brink of defeat with the Soviet Armies closing in from the west and south. In Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, {Adolf Hitler} proclaims that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his Generals and advisers to fight to the last man. "Downfall" explores these final days of the Reich, where senior German leaders (such as {Himmler} and {Goring}) began defecting from their beloved {Fuhrer}, in an effort to save their own lives, while still others ({Joseph Goebbels}) pledge to die with {Hitler}. {Hitler}, himself, degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man, full of optimism one moment and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes, and {Hitler} lies dead by his own hand, what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that is the Battle of Berlin, and lay down their arms in surrender.
