# Big Little Lies

When {Madeline} and {Celeste} take new-in-town single mom {Jane} under their wing, none of them realize how the arrival of {Jane} and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all. Big Little Lies is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.
