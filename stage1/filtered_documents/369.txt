# The Bugs Bunny Show

{Bugs} Bunny, the famous, Oscar-winning cartoon rabbit, hosts his first weekly television series, along with all his fellow Warner Brothers cartoon stars, including {Daffy} Duck, {Porky} Pig, {Elmer Fudd}, {Yosemite Sam}, the Tasmanian Devil, Tweety Bird, {Sylvester} Cat, the Road Runner, {Wile Coyote}, {Pepe Le Pew}, {Foghorn Leghorn}, and Speedy {Gonzales}. Each episode features three theatrical cartoons introduced by {Bugs} and/or the other characters, and often with a unifying idea, or theme. Many episodes feature {Bugs} as a lecturer on such subjects as cats, dogs, birds, and humans, and offering classic Warner Brothers cartoon footage to comically illustrate his points.
