# A Separation

{Nader} ({Payman Maadi}) and {Simin} (Leila Hatami) argue about living abroad. {Simin} prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter, {Termeh}. However, {Nader} refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and take care of his father ({Ali-Asghar Shahbazi}), who suffers from Alzheimers. However, {Simin} is determined to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter.
