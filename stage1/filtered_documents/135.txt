# Howl's Moving Castle

A love story between an 18-year-old girl named {Sophie}, cursed by a witch into an old woman's body, and a magician named {Howl}. Under the curse, {Sophie} sets out to seek her fortune, which takes her to Howl's strange moving castle. In the castle, {Sophie} meets {Howl}'s fire demon, named {Karishifâ}. Seeing that she is under a curse, the demon makes a deal with {Sophie}--if she breaks the contract he is under with {Howl}, then {Karushifâ} will lift the curse that {Sophie} is under, and she will return to her 18-year-old shape.
