# Sherlock

In this modernized version of the {Conan Doyle} characters, using his detective plots, {Sherlock Holmes} lives in early 21st century London and acts more cocky towards Scotland Yard's detective inspector {Lestrade} because he's actually less confident. Doctor {Watson} is now a fairly young veteran of the Afghan war, less adoring and more active.
