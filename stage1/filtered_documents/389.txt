# Poirot

This whodunit series based on {Agatha Christie}'s crime novels and short stories, is named after its star sleuth, {Hercule Poirot}, a famous former Belgian policeman, who settled for good in London after the war, soon so famous as an infallible private detective that he becomes a society figure in his own right. In each episode {Poirot} gets to solve a crime mystery -mostly murder(s)- for a paying client or otherwise catching his attention, generally along with his faithful English sidekick Captain {Hastings} and/or his Scotland yard 'friendly rival' Detective Chief Inspector {Japp}.
