# La Haine

The film follows three young men and their time spent in the French suburban "ghetto," over a span of twenty-four hours. {Vinz}, a Jew, {Sa√Ød}, an Arab, and {Hubert}, a black boxer, have grown up in these French suburbs where high levels of diversity coupled with the racist and oppressive police force have raised tensions to a critical breaking point. During the riots that took place a night before, a police officer lost his handgun in the ensuing madness, only to leave it for {Vinz} to find. Now, with a newfound means to gain the respect he deserves, {Vinz} vows to kill a cop if his friend {Abdel} dies in the hospital, due the beating he received while in police custody.
