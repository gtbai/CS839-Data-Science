# The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst

A groundbreaking six-part documentary directed and produced by {Andrew Jarecki} and produced and shot by {Marc Smerling} (the Oscar nominated behind "Capturing the Friedmans (2003)") delves into the strange history of real estate heir {Robert Durst}, long suspected in the still-unsolved 1982 disappearance of his wife as well as the subsequent murders of family friend {Susan Berman} and neighbor {Morris Black}. It features an extended, revealing interview with {Durst} himself, with whom {Jarecki} developed a unique relationship following the release of "All Good Things (2010)", {Jarecki}'s 2010 feature about {Durst}'s life starring {Ryan Gosling} and {Kirsten Dunst}. "The Jinx" results from nearly a decade of research by the filmmakers, who expose police files, key witnesses, never-before-seen footage, private prison recordings, and thousands of pages of formerly hidden documents.
