# {Django} Unchained

In 1858, a bounty hunter named {Schultz} seeks out a slave named {Django} and buys him because he needs him to find some men he is looking for. After finding them, {Django} wants to find his wife, {Broomhilda}, who along with him were sold separately by his former owner for trying to escape. {Schultz} offers to help him if he chooses to stay with him and be his partner. Eventually they learn that she was sold to a plantation in Mississippi. Knowing they can't just go in and say they want her, they come up with a plan so that the owner will welcome them into his home and they can find a way.
