# The Bandit

The epic adventures of the legendary {Baran} the Bandit following his release from prison. After serving 35 years, it is no surprise that the world has changed dramatically. Still, {Baran} can't help but be shocked to discover that his home village is now underwater thanks to the construction of a new dam. He then heads for Istanbul to get revenge upon his former best friend, the man who snitched on him and stole his lover {Keje}. Along the way, {Baran} teams up with {Cumali}, a tough young punk who finds the thief's old-fashioned ways rather quaint. When {Cumali} gets into deep trouble with a crime boss, {Baran} adds another vengeful task to his roster.
