# I, Claudius

This mini-series follows the history of the Roman Empire, from approximately the death of {Marcellus} (24/23 B.C.) to {Claudius}' own death in 54 A.D. As {Claudius} narrates his life, we witness {Augustus}' attempts to find an heir, often foiled by his wife {Livia} who wants her son {Tiberius} to become emperor. We also see the conspiracy of {Sejanus}, the infamous reign of {Caligula}, and {Claudius}' own troubled period of rule.
