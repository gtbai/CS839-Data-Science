# Doctor Who

The Doctor, a Time Lord from the race whose home planet is Gallifrey, travels through time and space in his/her ship the TARDIS (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension In Space) with numerous companions. From time to time he/she regenerates into a new form (which is how the series has been running since the departure of the original actor, {William Hartnell}, in 1966).
