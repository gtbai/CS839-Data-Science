His eldest and middle sons - {Taro} and {Jiro} - agree with his decision and promise to support him for his remaining days. The youngest son {Saburo} disagrees with all of them arguing that there is little likelihood the three brothers will remain united. Insulted by his son's brashness, the warlord banishes {Saburo}. As the warlord begins his retirement, he quickly realizes that his two eldest sons selfish and have no intention of keeping their promises. It leads to war and only banished {Saburo} can possibly save him.
